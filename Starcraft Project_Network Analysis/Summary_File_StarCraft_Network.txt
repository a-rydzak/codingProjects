Description:
The StarCraft network (directed, weighted), is a network created from 
61 scraped minor tournaments listed on liquipedia.  A list of all minor tournaments 
scraped, and their sources, can be found in the project Starcraft_scrape.py file.  In the network
a node is represented by a unique player.  A weighted direct edge leaves  
player A to another player B when player a has lost 1 or more matches to player B.  
The visa versa is true for an edge that leave Player B to Player A.  Players/nodes with 
a the most out degrees have lost the most matches.  Players/nodes with the most in degrees
are have won the most matches.  There are a variety of characteristics 
discussed and mentioned "G04_axr163231_smk160830.ppx."  Beyond network measurements, 
rivalry detection is identified utilizing co citation and graphlets for players who have
never played eachother. The PowerPoint file, "G04_axr163231_smk160830.ppx",
demonstrates the data and how the data is displayed.
 

Nodes: 752
Edges: 2,446
Note:  See the PowerPoint presentation for other traits and characteristics.
       Other files that will provide data of note include Starcraft_Tests.py and
       Starcefat_Project.py.
